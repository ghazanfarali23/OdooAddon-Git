# Research Report: Git Repository Commit to Timesheet Mapping Addon

**Date**: September 13, 2025  
**Feature**: Git Repository Commit to Timesheet Mapping Addon  
**Odoo Version**: 18.0-20250807

## Research Objectives

1. Odoo 18.0 addon development requirements and best practices
2. Git API integration patterns (GitHub/GitLab)
3. Odoo timesheet module integration approaches
4. Security and authentication patterns for external APIs
5. User interface design patterns in Odoo

## Findings

### 1. Odoo 18.0 Addon Development Standards

**Decision**: Use standard Odoo addon structure with Python 3.10+ and Odoo ORM
**Rationale**: 
- Odoo 18.0 requires Python 3.10+ for optimal performance
- Standard addon structure ensures compatibility and maintainability
- Odoo ORM provides robust database abstraction and security

**Key Requirements**:
- `__manifest__.py` with proper dependencies: `['project', 'hr_timesheet']`
- Follow Odoo naming conventions (snake_case for files, CamelCase for classes)
- Use Odoo's security framework (access rights, record rules)
- Implement proper translations support

**Alternatives Considered**: Custom Python application - rejected due to lack of Odoo integration

### 2. Git API Integration

**Decision**: Use PyGithub for GitHub and python-gitlab for GitLab APIs
**Rationale**:
- Well-maintained libraries with comprehensive API coverage
- Handle authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
- Support both public and private repositories
- Compatible with token-based authentication

**Authentication Approach**:
- GitHub: Personal Access Tokens (PATs) or GitHub Apps
- GitLab: Personal Access Tokens or OAuth2
- Store encrypted tokens in Odoo database using `tools.misc.encrypt/decrypt`

**Alternatives Considered**: 
- Direct REST API calls - rejected due to complexity
- git-python library - rejected as it requires local git repositories

### 3. Odoo Timesheet Integration

**Decision**: Extend `account.analytic.line` model for timesheet integration
**Rationale**:
- `account.analytic.line` is the core timesheet model in Odoo
- Provides built-in project/task relationships
- Includes user tracking and date/time handling
- Supports custom fields for commit references

**Integration Pattern**:
- Add custom fields to track commit hash, repository, and mapping status
- Create wizard for bulk mapping operations
- Implement validation to prevent duplicate mappings

**Alternatives Considered**: 
- Separate mapping table - rejected as it complicates queries
- Custom timesheet model - rejected due to loss of standard functionality

### 4. Security and Access Control

**Decision**: Role-based access with admin-only repository management
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with requirement FR-014 (admin-only full access)
- Protects sensitive repository credentials
- Maintains audit trail for security compliance

**Security Measures**:
- Encrypt stored API tokens using Odoo's encryption utilities
- Implement access control lists (ACL) for repository access
- Log all repository operations for audit purposes
- Validate user permissions before Git API calls

**Alternatives Considered**: User-level repository access - rejected due to security concerns

### 5. User Interface Design

**Decision**: Implement Odoo web interface with custom JavaScript components
**Rationale**:
- Provides native Odoo look and feel
- Leverages Odoo's responsive design framework
- Supports real-time updates and interactions
- Integrates with Odoo's notification system

**UI Components**:
- Repository connection form with test connection feature
- Commit browser with filtering and search capabilities
- Bulk mapping wizard with drag-and-drop interface
- Dashboard showing mapping statistics and recent activity

**Alternatives Considered**: 
- External web application - rejected due to integration complexity
- Pure backend with minimal UI - rejected due to usability requirements

### 6. Performance and Scalability

**Decision**: Implement caching and background job processing
**Rationale**:
- Git API calls can be slow for large repositories
- Background processing prevents UI blocking
- Caching reduces API rate limit consumption

**Performance Strategies**:
- Cache commit data with configurable TTL
- Use Odoo's queue_job module for background processing
- Implement pagination for large commit lists
- Add database indexes for fast lookups

**Alternatives Considered**: Synchronous processing - rejected due to timeout risks

### 7. Error Handling and Monitoring

**Decision**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
**Rationale**:
- Git APIs can fail due to network issues, rate limits, or permission changes
- Users need clear feedback about connection and mapping status
- System administrators need detailed error logs

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- Graceful degradation for API failures
- User notifications for authentication issues
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Technical Dependencies

### Required Python Packages
- `PyGithub>=1.59.0` - GitHub API integration
- `python-gitlab>=3.15.0` - GitLab API integration
- `requests>=2.31.0` - HTTP client with proper SSL support
- `python-dateutil>=2.8.0` - Date/time handling and timezone conversion

### Odoo Dependencies
- `project` - Project management functionality
- `hr_timesheet` - Timesheet functionality
- `queue_job` - Background job processing (recommended)

### Development Dependencies
- `responses>=0.23.0` - HTTP mocking for tests
- `freezegun>=1.2.0` - Time mocking for tests

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **API Rate Limits**: GitHub/GitLab APIs have rate limits that could impact usability
  - Mitigation: Implement caching and respect rate limit headers
- **Token Expiration**: Long-lived tokens may expire or be revoked
  - Mitigation: Token validation and refresh mechanisms

### Medium Risk
- **Large Repository Performance**: Repositories with thousands of commits may cause timeouts
  - Mitigation: Pagination and background processing
- **Network Connectivity**: Internet connectivity issues could disrupt service
  - Mitigation: Offline mode with cached data

### Low Risk
- **Odoo Version Compatibility**: Future Odoo versions may break compatibility
  - Mitigation: Follow Odoo best practices and version compatibility testing

## Next Steps

1. Phase 1: Design data models and API contracts
2. Create failing tests for core functionality
3. Implement models and basic CRUD operations
4. Develop Git API integration layer
5. Build user interface components
6. Implement bulk operations and wizards
7. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
8. Performance optimization and caching
