# Feature Specification: Git Repository Commit to Timesheet Mapping Addon

**Feature Branch**: `001-building-the-addon`  
**Created**: September 13, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "building the addon for Odoo 18.0-20250807. this addon will have the ability to connect with github or gitlab repositories both public or private. Then based on the repository and branch I pick. it will bring the commits. Then once I have all the commits I should be able to map these commits to the timesheets for a specific task to a specific project. I should be able to do bulk mapping. Also once a commit is mapped then it should be grayed out so I can not accidently assign it somewhere else. This should have a very friendly easy to use interface"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input ‚úì
   ‚Üí Feature involves Git repository integration with Odoo timesheets
2. Extract key concepts from description ‚úì
   ‚Üí Actors: project managers, developers, team members
   ‚Üí Actions: connect repos, fetch commits, map to timesheets, bulk operations
   ‚Üí Data: repositories, commits, timesheets, projects, tasks
   ‚Üí Constraints: prevent double-mapping, user-friendly interface
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Authentication methods for private repos marked for clarification
   ‚Üí Permission levels and user access controls marked for clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ‚úì
   ‚Üí Primary workflow: connect repo ‚Üí select branch ‚Üí fetch commits ‚Üí map to timesheets
5. Generate Functional Requirements ‚úì
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on user capabilities and system behaviors
6. Identify Key Entities ‚úì
   ‚Üí Repository connections, commits, timesheet mappings
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Some [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items remain for business decisions
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project manager or team lead, I want to automatically track developer time by mapping Git commits to specific project tasks and timesheets, so that I can have accurate time tracking without manual timesheet entry and better visibility into development progress against project deliverables.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have access to a GitHub/GitLab repository, **When** I configure the repository connection with proper credentials, **Then** the system successfully connects and I can browse available branches
2. **Given** I have selected a repository and branch, **When** I fetch commits from a specific time period, **Then** the system displays all commits with author, timestamp, and commit message
3. **Given** I have a list of fetched commits, **When** I select multiple commits and choose a project task, **Then** the system creates timesheet entries for those commits and marks them as mapped
4. **Given** a commit has already been mapped to a timesheet, **When** I view the commit list, **Then** the mapped commit appears grayed out and cannot be selected for mapping again
5. **Given** I want to map many commits efficiently, **When** I use bulk selection features, **Then** I can select multiple commits by author, date range, or commit message patterns and map them all at once

### Edge Cases
- What happens when repository credentials expire or become invalid?
- How does the system handle commits from deleted or renamed branches?
- What occurs if a timesheet entry is deleted after commit mapping?
- How does the system behave when multiple users try to map the same commit simultaneously?
- What happens when repository access is revoked mid-session?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to configure connections to both GitHub and GitLab repositories (public and private)
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate and validate repository access before allowing commit fetching
- **FR-003**: System MUST display available branches for connected repositories and allow branch selection
- **FR-004**: System MUST fetch and display commit information including author, timestamp, commit hash, and commit message
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow filtering commits by date range, author, or commit message keywords
- **FR-006**: System MUST enable mapping individual commits to specific project tasks and timesheet entries
- **FR-007**: System MUST support bulk mapping operations for multiple commits to the same task
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent double-mapping by marking mapped commits as unavailable and visually distinct (grayed out)
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain mapping history and allow viewing which commits are mapped to which timesheets
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide an intuitive user interface for all repository and mapping operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with existing Odoo project and timesheet modules
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate that target projects and tasks exist before allowing commit mapping
- **FR-013**: System MUST support repository credential management with standard security requirements, if token is expired should alert the user to re-authenticate.
- **FR-014**: System MUST control user access to repository connections based on role-based access, only admin can do everything.
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle commit time zone conversion and user will do manual timesheet time handling

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Repository Connection**: Represents configured Git repository access, includes repository URL, authentication credentials, connection status, and repository type (GitHub/GitLab)
- **Commit Record**: Represents individual Git commits with metadata including commit hash, author, timestamp, message, branch, and mapping status
- **Commit Mapping**: Links commits to Odoo timesheet entries, includes mapping timestamp, mapped user, and prevents duplicate mappings
- **Timesheet Integration**: Extends existing Odoo timesheet entries with commit references and automated time calculation capabilities
